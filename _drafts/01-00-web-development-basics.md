# Web Development Basics

Itâ€™s pretty obvious that if you want to become a Web Developer then you should know the basics of internet, web applications, protocols like HTTP and web development in general. Thankfully there are a lot of courses where you can not only learn these but much more than that.
 
I recommend the following resources for all programmers who want to learn Web Development:
