If you want to become a professional React developer then you should spend some time to get familiar with tools that you will be using as a web developer like built tools, unit testing tools, debugging tools etc.

To start with here are some of the build tools mentioned in this roadmap:

Package Managers

* npm
* yarn
* pnpm
* Task Runners
* npm scripts
* gulp
* Webpack
* Rollup
