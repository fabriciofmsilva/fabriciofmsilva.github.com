# TypeScript

Just like we have C and [C++](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html), TypeScript can be considered as JavaScript++ though itâ€™s not as popular as C++.

The good part of [TypeScript](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/07/top-5-courses-to-learn-typescript.html) is that it adds type-safety in JavaScript code which means you can catch nasty JavaScript type related errors in the development phase.

It also makes developing object-oriented code easily for JavaScript.
