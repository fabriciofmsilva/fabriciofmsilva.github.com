Now, this is one of the important skill for React Developers which is often overlooked, but if you want to stay ahead from your competition then you should focus on learning libraries which will help you in testing. Here also, you have libraries for Unit testing, Integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

Here is a list of libraries mentioned in the roadmap:

Unit Testing

* Jest
* Enzyme
* Sinon
* Mocha
* Chai
* AVA
* Tape

End to End Testing

* Selenium, Webdriver
* Cypress
* Puppeteer
* Cucumber.js
* Nightwatch.js

Integration Testing

* Karma

You can learn the library you want but Jest and Enzyme are recommended.
