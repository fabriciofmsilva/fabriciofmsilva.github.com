# Data Structures and Algorithms

These are the building blocks of any program and better knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structure is key for your next job or doing well on your current job.

If you are interested in learning algorithms and data structure, I suggest you choose the course which is in the programming language you understand.

For example for Java developers [Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java%2F) is a good one to start with.

Similarly for JavaScript Developers Colt Steele’s [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjs-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass%2F) is a good one.

And, if you use Python then [Algorithms and Data Structures in Python](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Falgorithms-and-data-structures-in-python%2F) is a nice one.

And, if you don’t mind learning from resources then you can also use this list of [free algorithms courses](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-free-data-structure-and-algorithm-courses-java--c-programmers.html) to start with.
