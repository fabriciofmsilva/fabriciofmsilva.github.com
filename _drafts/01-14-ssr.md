You might be thinking what is the difference between Server-Side Rendering and Client Side rendering, let's clear that before talking about the library which supports Server Side Rendering with React.

Well, In Client-side rendering, your browser downloads a minimal HTML page. It then renders the JavaScript and fills the content into it.

While in the case of Server-side rendering, React components are rendered on the server and output HTML content is delivered to the client or browser.

The RoadMap recommends following Server-Side Rendering:

* Next.js
* After.js
* Rogue

But, I suggest learning just Next.js should be enough, and Thankfully, Max's [React 16 - The Complete Guide](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=508237.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Freact-the-complete-guide-incl-redux%2F)  also covers Next.js basics which should be good enough to start with.
