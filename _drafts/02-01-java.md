# Java

I am primarily a Java developer who have learned Web Development and other programming languages, hence when it comes to developing backend my preferred choice is Java. You can either use [Core Java](http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html) or [Java + Spring Boot](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-6-spring-framework-online-courses-Java-programmers.html) to write a cutting edge, high-performance backend. If you want to go Java and Spring route, here are a couple of courses you can join to get up-to-speed.
