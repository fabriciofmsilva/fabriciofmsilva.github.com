## HTTP / HTTPS

The HTTP protocol is the backbone of web and a good knowledge of both HTTP and HTTPS is mandatory for a web developer.

If you want to become a web developer then it's an absolute must to know HTTP and know it well. I am not asking you to read the specification but you should at least be familiar with common HTTP request methods like the GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS and how HTTP/HTTPS works in general.
