If this sounds too much to you, I suggest you to just focus on Redux, it's great and there is a great course from Stephen Grider to learn Redux framework well.

Both Max's React 16- The Complete Guide and Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux courses also covers State Management in React and Redux in good detail.


### Form Helpers

Apart from Type Checkers, it's also good to learn Form Helps like Redux Form, which provides the best way to manage your form state in Redux. Apart from Redux Form, you can also take a look at Formik, Formsy, and Final form.


### Routing

Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model, and Routing components are an important part of any application.

React Router provides a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.

Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering.

Apart from React-Router, you can also take a look at Router 5, Redux-First Router and React Router.

Both Max's React 16 - The Complete Guide and Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux courses also covers React Router in good detail.
