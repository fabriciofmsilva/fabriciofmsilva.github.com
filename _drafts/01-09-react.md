# React JS

Similar to [Angular](https://hackernoon.com/top-10-angular-courses-tutorials-and-books-for-web-developers-e8a8e2c490c2), [React](https://hackernoon.com/the-2018-react-js-roadmap-4d0a43814c02) is also a popular library for developing web applications. It allows you to write reusable components which you can then use to create modern looking interactive web pages.

Like Angular is backed by Google, React is backed by Facebook and hence quite popular. If you want to learn React then you either join Stephen Grider’s [Modern React with Redux](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Freact-redux%2F) or Max’s [React  The Complete Guide](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Freact-the-complete-guide-incl-redux%2F) on Udemy. Both are excellent courses to learn to React online.

Now, this is the main deal. you got to learn React and learn it well to become a React developer. The best place to learn React is the official website but as a beginner, it can be a little bit overwhelming for you.

That's why I suggest you enroll in a couple of courses like Max's React MasterClass or Stephen Grider's React and Redux to learn to React well. Those two are my favorite React courses and also trusted by thousands of web developers.

If you are serious about your React skills I strongly suggest you look at these courses.
