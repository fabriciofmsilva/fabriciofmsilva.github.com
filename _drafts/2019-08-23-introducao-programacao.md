Fazer uma introdução

## Código

Código fonte (source code)

Linguagem de computador, sintaxe

## Statements

In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement. 

a = b * 2;

## Expressões

Statements are made up of one or more expressions.

a = b * 2;

## Execução

Console

### Input

prompt

### Output

alert e console.log

## Operators

Assignment: = as in a = 2.

Math: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division), as in a * 3.

Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, and /= are compound operators that combine a math operation with assignment, as in a += 2 (same as a = a + 2).

Increment/Decrement: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), as in a++ (similar to a = a + 1).

Object Property Access: . as in console.log().

Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. obj.a means an object value called obj with a property of the name a. Properties can alternatively be accessed as obj["a"]. See Chapter 2.

Equality: == (loose-equals), === (strict-equals), != (loose not-equals), !== (strict not-equals), as in a == b.

See "Values & Types" and Chapter 2.

Comparison: < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or loose-equals), >= (greater than or loose-equals), as in a <= b.

See "Values & Types" and Chapter 2.

Logical: && (and), || (or), as in a || b that selects either a or b.

## Valores e tipos

string/number/boolean, array, objects, functions

### Convertento entre tipos

explicit coercion and implicit coercion 

## Comentários

Code without comments is suboptimal.

Too many comments (one per line, for example) is probably a sign of poorly written code.

Comments should explain why, not what. They can optionally explain how if that's particularly confusing.

One line, multiple lines

## Variáveis

Static typing, otherwise known as type enforcement

Weak typing, otherwise known as dynamic typing

var, conversão sobre CONSTANTES, const

## Blocos

{}

## Condicionais

if, else, else if, switch

## Laços (Loops)

while, do while, for

## Funções

section of code that can be "called" by name,

### Escopo

scope (technically called lexical scope)

## Exemplo prático
