* TypeScript
* Flow

Since JavaScript is not a strongly typed language, you don't have the luxury of a compiler to catch those sneaky type related bug.

As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with type checking, especially if you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to type check your whole application.

But even if you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in type checking abilities and learning them can help you to catch bugs early.

Since Angular also uses TypeScript, I think it's worth to learn TypeScript along with JavaScript, and if you also think so then you can check out the [Ultimate TypeScript course](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/07/top-5-courses-to-learn-typescript.html#axzz5QyVwWVg3) on Udemy.
