# Node.js

There are many choices to develop your web application’s backend e.g. you can use Java and Spring or maybe [Python](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/10-free-python-courses-for-programmers.html) + [Django](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/04/top-5-python-web-development-frameworks.html) but in recent year Node.js has come up as the preferred option.

The best thing about [NodeJS](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html) is that it allows you to develop a complete web application using just one programming language  JavaScript.

If you want to go Node route, then [The Complete Node.js Developer course](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html) by Rob Percival and Andrew Mead is best to start with.
