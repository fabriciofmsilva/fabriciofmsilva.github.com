# API Clients

In today's world, you will rarely build an isolated GUI, instead, there is more chance that you will build something which communicates with other application using APIs like REST and GraphQL. Thankfully, there are many API clients available for React developers, here is a list of them:

REST

* Fetch
* SuperAgent
* axios

GraphQL

* Apollo
* Relay
* urql

Apollo Client is my favorite and provides an easy way to use GraphQL to build client applications. The client is designed to help you quickly build a UI that fetches data with GraphQL and can be used with any JavaScript front-end

Btw, if you don't know GraphQL and REST, I suggest you to spend some time learning them. If you need courses, the following are my recommendations:
